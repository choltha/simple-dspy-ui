# Simple DSPy Ui

## Goals
Enable everyone to profit from DSPy super prompts.

Main focus should be ease of use.

Maximum transparency:
- Simple wording, tooltips for advanced explainations / DSPy wording
- Show progress (diff view betweeen steps?)

Explainer, that DSPy is basically machinelearning applied to prompts and needs examples for train/test.
Add tooling to generate exactly such initial data to get the DSPy flywheel going.

## Sections / Tabs
1. Data generation. Not really DSPy but a loop to get some basic data going.
2. DSPy Tab, use data generated on 1st Tab to run the actual DSPy experiments.

## Techstack
- dspy
- gradio for max prototyping speed

## Credits
- DSPy is the backbone of this project

## Thinks to keep in Mind
Avoid putting it on rails too much, magic comes from end-to-end AI experimentation!

## Ideas
DSPy code export: Setup and experiment, be able to generate DSPy-Code which represents the setup.
