# Simple DSPy Ui

## Goals
Enable everyone to profit from DSPy super prompts.

Main focus should be ease of use.

Maximum transparency:
- Simple wording, tooltips for advanced explainations / DSPy wording
- Show progress (diff view betweeen steps?)


Credits: DSPy is the backbone of this project.

## Roadmap

### Prototype

#### MVP
Setup Gradio locally. Implement fewshot:
- Meta description of what to do (Signature)
- At least one example of how to do it (input / output)
- Resulting Prompt for copy/paste to other tools
- API Key input field
- Backend: Target Model is gpt-3.5-turbo, judge is gpt-4o

## Techstack
- dspy
- gradio for max prototyping speed

## Thinks to keep in Mind
Avoid putting it on rails too much, magic comes from end-to-end AI experimentation!

## Ideas
DSPy code export: Setup and experiment, be able to generate DSPy-Code which represents the setup.
