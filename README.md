# Simple DSPy Ui

## Goals
Enable everyone to profit from DSPy super prompts.

Main focus should be ease of use.

Maximum transparency:
- Simple wording, tooltips for advanced explainations / DSPy wording
- Show progress (diff view betweeen steps?)


Credits: DSPy is the backbone of this project.

## Techstack
- dspy
- gradio for max prototyping speed

## Thinks to keep in Mind
Avoid putting it on rails too much, magic comes from end-to-end AI experimentation!

## Ideas
DSPy code export: Setup and experiment, be able to generate DSPy-Code which represents the setup.
